## Getting Started

### Survey
If you haven't done so already, please fill out the [pre-workshop survey](https://rstudio-connect.dmap-stage.aws.epa.gov/content/50d3d879-a0c9-4757-87dc-202b59c3fb3a/). You will need to be on the VPN to access the survey.

### Prepare to code
We will be doing some hands on exercises during the workshop. If you do not have access to a recent version of r and rstudio on your computer, you can sign up for a free [POSIT.cloud](https://login.posit.cloud/register?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.login.posit.cloud%2Foauth%2Flogin%3Fshow_auth%3D0%26show_login%3D0) account. posit.cloud will give you access to a full version of RStudio in your web browser.

You should also download this repository as it contains all of the data and code we will be using throughout the workshop. This will also allow you to access the slides.
